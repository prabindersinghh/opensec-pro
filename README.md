## The problem with every other security tool

They give you a list of 47 findings.  
You fix maybe 3 of them — the ones you're sure about.  
The other 44 sit there because you can't tell what's real.

**OpenSec Intelligence solves the trust problem.**

It doesn't just find the vulnerability. It runs an exploit to prove it exists, patches it with a local AI, then runs the same exploit again to prove the patch closed the hole. You see exactly what happened at every step.

```bash
npm install -g opensec-intelligence
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b
opensec scan ./
```

---

## The prove loop

This is what makes OpenSec different from every other free tool.

```bash
opensec prove ./
```

```

```

**What's happening:**
1. A local LLM writes a minimal exploit script for the finding
2. The script runs in a sandboxed subprocess and confirms the vuln fires (`🔴`)
3. The Fixer agent writes and applies the patch
4. The same exploit runs again — it must fail (`✅`)
5. Proof saved to `.opensec/proofs/` for audit

No other free, local tool does this. Most enterprise tools don't either.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install
npm install -g opensec-intelligence

# Pull a model (free, runs locally — one time)
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b

# Scan your repo
opensec scan ./

# See it on a deliberately vulnerable demo app
opensec scan --demo
```

**No account. No API key. Nothing leaves your machine.**

## How it works

```
Your codebase
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Scanner   │  Walks every file — code, Dockerfiles, k8s, .env,
│             │  Terraform, CI/CD — in under 30 seconds.
│             │  25+ deterministic rules. No LLM needed here.
└──────┬──────┘
       │ structured findings JSON
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Analyst   │  Sends each HIGH/CRITICAL finding to a local LLM
│             │  with ±15 lines of file context.
│             │  Filters anything below 0.7 confidence.
└──────┬──────┘
       │ confirmed findings
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Consensus  │  Adversarial second pass on every CRITICAL.
│             │  Tries to argue the finding ISN'T a vulnerability.
│             │  If it still holds up — it's real.
└──────┬──────┘
       │ validated findings
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│    Fixer    │  Writes the exact patch.
│             │  Shows you a colored before/after diff.
│             │  [A]pply / [S]kip / [Q]uit — you decide.
│             │  Git commits on approval.
└─────────────┘
```

The insight that makes this work: **single-model tools hallucinate**. If one model says something is a vulnerability, it might be wrong. OpenSec's consensus layer requires independent confirmation — if models disagree, you don't get paged.

## What gets scanned

| Category | File types |
|---|---|
| **Code** | `.py` `.js` `.ts` `.go` `.rb` `.java` `.php` `.rs` `.cpp` `.cs` |
| **Infrastructure** | `Dockerfile` `docker-compose.yml` `*.tf` `*.hcl` `*.toml` |
| **Kubernetes / Config** | `*.yaml` `*.yml` `openapi.*` `*.json` |
| **Secrets** | `.env` `.env.*` `*.pem` `*.key` `*.p12` `*.pfx` |
| **CI/CD** | `.github/workflows/*.yml` `.gitlab-ci.yml` `Jenkinsfile` |

What gets detected: AWS/GitHub/Stripe keys, hardcoded passwords, SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, CORS wildcards, weak crypto (MD5/SHA1), eval usage, Docker root users, k8s privileged containers, Terraform open security groups, and more.

## Commands

```bash
# Scan
opensec scan ./              # Full 4-agent scan
opensec scan ./ --quick      # Deterministic scanner only (no LLM, instant)
opensec scan ./ --ci         # JSON output, exit 1 on CRITICAL — use in CI/CD
opensec scan --demo          # Run on bundled vulnerable app — see the pipeline live

# Prove + fix
opensec prove ./             # Generate exploit → confirm → patch → re-confirm
opensec prove ./ --dry-run   # Generate and run exploit, skip patching
opensec prove ./ --show-exploit  # Print the LLM-generated exploit code
opensec fix                  # Apply patches from last scan interactively

# Report + serve
opensec report               # HTML security report
opensec serve --port 4141    # Start HTTP + MCP server

# Model
opensec -m llama3.2:3b       # Override Ollama model
```

## GitLab Transcend / OpenSec Remediation Flow

This repository includes a GitLab-native Path B implementation:

- `.gitlab-ci.yml` runs Node 20 validation, build/lint/unit tests, deterministic
  OpenSec scanning, HTML/JSON artifacts, isolated proof verification, packaging,
  an allowlisted manual staging deployment, and a post-deployment health check.
- `.gitlab/duo/flows/opensec-remediation.yml` defines the custom Duo Agent
  Platform flow. It reads findings, proposes the smallest patch on an isolated
  branch, opens a merge request, and requires pipeline/proof evidence before it
  reports success.
- `AGENTS.md` contains the project-level safety rules used by Duo flows.
- `npm run live-lab` starts the local browser demo at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`.
  It scans only the bundled vulnerable application; it never accepts a target
  path from the browser.

The deterministic CI path does not require Ollama. Model-based remediation is
optional and must be configured in GitLab Duo. Deployment is intentionally
manual and refuses to run unless `DEMO_DEPLOY_TARGET=approved-staging` and a
masked `DEMO_DEPLOY_COMMAND` are configured. `DEMO_LAB_URL` enables the final
health check. These external steps are not represented as successful until a
real GitLab project executes them.

Validate the flow locally with:

```bash
npm ci
npm run security:flow-validate
npm run security:proof -- artifacts/proof-result.json artifacts/remediation-result.json
```

---

## CI/CD integration

```bash
# .github/workflows/security.yml
opensec scan ./ --ci --output json
# exits 1 if any CRITICAL findings — blocks the merge
```

See [`.github/workflows/opensec.yml`](.github/workflows/opensec.yml) for a full example.

---

## MCP integration

OpenSec exposes an MCP server so any MCP-compatible tool (Claude Code, goose, Cursor) can call it:

```bash
opensec serve --port 4141
# connect any MCP client to http://localhost:4141/v1/stream
```

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scan_repo` | Trigger a full or quick scan |
| `get_findings` | Structured JSON of last scan results |
| `apply_fix` | Apply a specific validated fix |
| `prove_finding` | Run the prove loop on a specific finding |
| `get_report` | Generate HTML report |

---

## Model recommendations

| Model | RAM | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen2.5-coder:14b` | 16GB | Best overall — recommended |
| `deepseek-r1:14b` | 16GB | Best for the consensus reasoning pass |
| `codellama:13b` | 16GB | Balanced speed + accuracy |
| `llama3.2:3b` | 8GB | Fast scanner on low RAM machines |

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b   # recommended
ollama pull llama3.2:3b          # minimum spec
```

---

## Local vs Cloud

| Mode | Cost | Privacy | Command |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Local** (default) | Free | 100% private | `opensec scan ./` |
| **Quick** | Free | 100% private | `opensec scan ./ --quick` |
| **Cloud** | API cost | Analyst + Consensus only | `opensec scan ./ --cloud` |

Cloud mode keeps Scanner and Fixer fully local. Only the confirmation passes use cloud models.

---

## Safety

The prove loop runs exploit code in a sandboxed subprocess:

- Real credentials and environment variables are never passed to the subprocess
- `eval()` and `new Function()` string codegen are disabled inside the subprocess
- Network access is blocked before execution
- Filesystem writes outside `/tmp` are blocked
- Hard 10-second timeout
- Exploit files are deleted immediately after use

> ⚠️ Do not run `opensec prove` on untrusted code. File content is embedded in the LLM prompt — a crafted file could influence the generated exploit. Full isolation requires a container.
